// we make a house object with tenant and lord

const lord = house;
lord.paint = "red";
console.log(house.paint); // lord painted the house in red

const tenant = house;
tenant.paint = "peach";
console.log(house.paint); // tenant painted the house in peach so the final output is peach
tenant.rent = "Rs3000";
console.log(house.rent); //tenant bragained the rent

//  so here we can see that value assigned to an object is stored in memory location not in the object directly so when we update or assign new value we see it in final execution of code

// now we add property or keys/

house.saleValue = "Rs 10000000";
console.log(house); //key and value is added to the object

// Works the same way as the spread operator.

// The first argument ({}) is the target â€” a new object.


// sometimes we have to call a value multiple time in that case we can use a  syntax
