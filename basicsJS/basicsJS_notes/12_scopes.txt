## addition note ## 
we should aware of what is the code going to do and where it will put values and what time it will take to do the job . It is more important than just knowing coding.





hoistin isHoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, before code execution.

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, before code execution.

Hoisting with var (Variables)

console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;

 Why doesn't this throw an error?
Because JS hoists the declaration (var x;) to the top:


var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 5;
Only the declaration is hoisted, not the assignment.

Hoisting with let and const

console.log(y); //  ReferenceError
let y = 10;
Variables declared with let or const are hoisted too, but they are placed in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) until the line where they are defined.
