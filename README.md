# 🔁 JavaScript Revision Journey

Hi there!

This project is my personal journey to **revisit and strengthen** my understanding of JavaScript.  
I'm going over all the important concepts — from basics to advanced — step by step, in a clear and focused way.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This


Instead of rushing, I’m taking time to truly understand how JavaScript works.  
This is not my first time learning JS — it’s a **revision** to improve my logic, confidence, and coding skills.

## 📘 What I’ve Done So Far

### ✅ Getting Started
- Set up my tools (VS Code, browser, GitHub)
- Created a simple plan with clear topics
- Decided to learn at my own pace — one topic at a time

---

### ✅ Objects (Non-Primitive Data)
- Revised how objects work in JavaScript
- Learned how to add, change, and delete properties
- Understood how `const` works with objects
- Started exploring how memory and references behave in JS

---

## 🔜 What’s Coming Next
- More about object methods and nested objects  
- Arrays, functions, and loops  
- DOM, events, and asynchronous JavaScript  
- ES6+ features and best practices
