📘 JavaScript – Brief But Informed Notes fromm chat gpt 
📌 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It makes websites interactive (buttons, animations, sliders).
Originally ran only in browsers, now also runs on servers via Node.js.

📜 Who Invented JavaScript?

Brendan Eich, in 1995, while working at Netscape.
Built the first version in 10 days.
Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, finally renamed JavaScript.

🧠 Why Was JavaScript Created?

To make web pages dynamic (forms, clicks, popups).
HTML + CSS were not enough for real-time interaction.
Netscape wanted a lightweight scripting language for the browser.

AI/ML (TensorFlow.js)
IoT (Johnny-Five)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚀 Why JavaScript is Still Popular
Works in every browser

Huge ecosystem (npm = millions of libraries)
Full-stack power (frontend + backend)
Constant updates (modern, flexible, scalable)
Massive job demand + community
