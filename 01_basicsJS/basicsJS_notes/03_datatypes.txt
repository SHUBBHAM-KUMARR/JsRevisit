non primitive datatype are datatype  which can store multiple values of different datatypes can be primitive or non primitive .

they are of object or function mostly

types of non primitive datatypes :
array object function map date set

objects:
it stores data in form of keys and value which are paired

keys are string
value can be of any datatype
{}is used to define object
you can change value of variable in future as it is mutable

these are stored by refrence not by value that means an object which is

const car ={brand:"tesla"};
brand: tesla is not stored  in car object directly instead it get stored in a memory location 
we can do following wit object
--add a key and value                    object.key=value
--delete a key and value                 delete object.key        
--modify a key and value                 object.key = new value 

we ca access a key using 
.
console.log(user.name)
