//
he forEach() method of Array instances executes a provided function once for each array element.

each callback function holds upto 3 arguments

Notes:
It does not return a new array (unlike .map()).

Doesn’t break or return early – use a regular for loop if you need to stop mid-way.

It's useful for running side effects (e.g., console.log, DOM manipulation).
