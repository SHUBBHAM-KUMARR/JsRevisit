## Variable = container that stores value of datatypes . in  JS we do not have to declare datatype  of variable.
--example
-- let name = "shubham" // js knows it's a string
-- const age = 18 // js knows it's a number of type int
-- const gpa = 8.7 // js knows it's a float 

** and so on it verifies each datatype dynamically 

There are there variable js 

-- let : value stored in it can be reassigned  
         it has a block scope

--const : value cannot be reassigned 
         it has block scope

--var(use in rare case,avoid ): old way of declaring variable 
                                it has function scoped 

scopes : Scope refers to the area in code where a variable is accessible (i.e., where you can use it).
        You can think of scope like "visibility range" of a variable — whether it can be seen from inside, outside, or only within a certain block or function.

Types of Scope in JavaScript:

   Scope Type	                            Description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   |  Global Scope	  | Declared outside any block or function → Accessible everywhere
   |  Function Scope	| Declared inside a function → Only accessible inside that function
   |  Block Scope	    | Declared inside {} block (like if, for, while) → Only accessible inside that block
   |  Lexical Scope	  | Inner functions have access to variables defined in their outer functions
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   let us see about statically  type languages
   like java c++ C etc
   in these language we have declare value statically i.e we spacify its datatype

   int a = 5; integer is defined
   string s = "shubham"
   like wise we delcare the datatype of variable but in js or python we just name the variable
