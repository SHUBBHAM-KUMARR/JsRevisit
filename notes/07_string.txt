strings  are  variable that stores character or sequence of character in "",'',``
string have several methods by which we can access its index of character,character on specific index etc..
declaration of strings

let name = "shubham"
let surname = 'kumar'

we can concatinate the strings using + operation

const car = "Thar"
const brand = "Mahindra"

console.log(brand + car) but here we will find no space between the values 
so eihter we can start value in brand "Mahindra" with some space " Mahindra"

or during console we can add a "withsomespace"
