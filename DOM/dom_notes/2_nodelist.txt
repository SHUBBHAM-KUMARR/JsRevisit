NodeList objects are collections of nodes, usually returned by properties such as Node.childNodes and methods such as document.querySelectorAll().

nodelist seem to be array but they are different though they are indexable and have length but it does not has all array methods

their are two type of node list 
1.static => not  updatable
2.live   => can be updated

querySelector creates nodelist and for using method which are not present in this method be need to convert it in array
