The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of objects. Each element (like a <div>, <p>, or <img>) becomes a node in the tree, allowing programming languages like JavaScript to access and manipulate the content, structure, and styling of the document dynamically.

In Simple Terms:
The DOM is how browsers understand and interact with HTML and XML documents. It lets JavaScript "see" and change the content and layout of a webpage after it has been loaded.

Key Concepts:
Concept	Description
Document	The webpage loaded in the browser.
Object	Every part of the HTML (like <body>, <h1>, text, etc.) becomes an object.
Model	These objects are arranged in a tree structure, forming a model of the page.

 DOM Tree Example:
Given this HTML:


<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome!</p>
  </body>
</html>
The DOM Tree would look like:


Document
└── html
    └── body
        ├── h1
        │   └── "Hello"
        └── p
            └── "Welcome!"
Why DOM is Important:
Dynamic Updates: JavaScript can add/remove/change elements without reloading the page.

Interactivity: DOM lets you respond to events like clicks, keypresses, etc.

Styling: You can change CSS styles directly through DOM manipulation.

Example in JavaScript:

document.getElementById("myTitle").innerText = "New Title";
This finds an element with the ID myTitle and changes its text.

 Summary:
DOM is the bridge between HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

It turns the document into a tree of objects you can access and manipulate.

It's platform- and language-independent, though most commonly used with JavaScript in browsers
